# Contributing to MACGo

Welcome to MACGo! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the guidelines outlined in this document.

## GitHub Flow

We follow the GitHub Flow for managing contributions to this project. The GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that emphasizes simplicity and collaboration.

### How It Works

1. **Fork**: Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rprata/macgo.git
    ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature/my-new-feature` or `bugfix/issue-123`.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
    ```

4. **Make Changes**: Make changes to the codebase. Ensure your code follows our coding guidelines.

5. **Commit**: Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message. Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
    ```

6. **Push**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-new-feature
    ```

7. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Open a Pull Request on the original repository's `main` branch. Provide a descriptive title and detailed description of your changes. Mention any related issues.

8. **Review**: Collaborate with project maintainers and other contributors to review and discuss your changes.

9. **Merge**: Once your PR is approved and passes any required tests, it will be merged into the `main` branch.

10. **Cleanup**: After your changes are merged, you can safely delete your feature branch.

    ```bash
    git branch -d feature/my-new-feature
    ```
